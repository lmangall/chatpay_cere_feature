# ChatPay X Cere

Hackathon judges and organizers FAQ:

Why so little code, why only having a feature open source ?
The ChatPay team is really dedicated in working on its product. We want to work on it and develop it, we believe it is a project for the common good, but we don't want to give it away ;-)

At what stage is ChatPay ?
Our product is still an "advanced POC" with 1300+ users (organic). While we develop the product itself we seek for strategic partnerships and investment

How can ChatPay and The Blockspace, Web0 organization and key-members collaborate
Key-partnership (in AI or data acquisition as instance) and establishing connection with potential investors (finders fee) are of mutual interest
