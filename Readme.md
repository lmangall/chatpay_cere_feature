# ChatPay X Cere X WebZero

ChatPay is a [Telegram Mini App](https://t.me/chatpayapp_bot/chatpayapp) that brings decentralization to data acquisition for the common good, allowing users to sell their data instead of having it taken by large platforms.

During this hackathon, we developed a feature that allows users to store the data generated during quests in a decentralized manner, leveraging [Cere](https://www.cere.network/)'s technology.
