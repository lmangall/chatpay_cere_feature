Our product is currently at an **"advanced Proof of Concept"** stage, with over **1,300 organic users**. As we continue to develop the product, we are actively seeking **strategic partnerships** and **investment opportunities**.

### How can ChatPay, The Blockspace, Web0 organization, and key members collaborate?
